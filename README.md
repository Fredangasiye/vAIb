# vAIb Viewer - Minimal Next.js Site (Ready for Vercel)

This is a minimal, production-ready **viewer** website for the vAIb platform. It shows a polished homepage, a demo project gallery (from local JSON), and simple styles inspired by your palette (purple → blue gradient).

## How to deploy (Drag & Drop on Vercel)
1. Download the ZIP file: `vaib-viewer.zip`.
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new and choose "Import Project" → "Upload" (drag-and-drop the ZIP).
3. Use the default settings. Vercel will detect Next.js automatically.
4. Click **Deploy**. Your live link will be available in a few minutes.

## How to run locally (optional)
1. Unzip the ZIP locally.
2. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- This is a viewer-only version (no CMS). Projects are loaded from `data/projects.json`.
- To convert to a full app later, connect a headless CMS and replace the local JSON data fetch.
